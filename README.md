- ### ðŸ”ˆRCD has been used in the 'Learning & Practice' business of the [HUAWEI Educational Center APP](https://appgallery.huawei.com/app/C101178177?sharePrepath=ag&locale=zh_CN&source=appshare&subsource=C101178177&shareTo=copylink&shareFrom=appmarket&shareIds=74fcdcc6737c459a87ca7140baba644a_8&callType=SHARE), since 2022. 

## Environment Settings
- Torch version: '1.7.1'
- DGL version: '0.6.1'

## Example to Run the Codes
To run the codes using the Junyi dataset:
1. Navigate to the code directory:
   ```
   cd RCD/RCD
   ```
2. Create two folders '/model' and '/result':
   ```
   mkdir model result
   ```
3. Build exercise-concept correlation local map:
   ```
   python build_k_e_graph.py
   ```
4. Build student-exercise interaction local map:
   ```
   python build_u_e_graph.py
   ```
5. Train and test RCD model:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

**Note**: Exercise-concept correlation local map and student-exercise interaction local map can be constructed by running `build_k_e_graph.py` and `build_u_e_graph.py` respectively.

## Dataset
### Junyi
- `log_data.json`: Student exercising records. [Source](https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduData)
- `train_set.json`: Data file for training.
- `test_set.json`: Data file for testing.
- `graph/K_Directed.txt`: Prerequisite relation from concept dependency local map, where each line is a prerequisite relation from the concept dependency local map: precursor_concept_ID\t succeed_concept_ID.
- `graph/K_Undirected.txt`: Similarity relation from concept dependency local map, where each line is a similarity relation from concept dependency local map: concept_ID\t similar_concept_ID.

**Note**: Concept dependency local map construction details are provided in the paper. 

### ASSIST
- `log_data.json`: Student exercising records.
